## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Output

The enhanced system now produces enterprise-grade accessibility reports with:
- Detailed JSON attachments for each test category
- Comprehensive metrics and summaries
- Actionable issue descriptions with element context
- Severity classifications (critical, serious, moderate, minor)
- Structured reporting format suitable for CI/CD integration

## ðŸ“‹ Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `playwright.config.js` - Enhanced configuration
- `tests/accessibility/accessibility.spec.js` - Comprehensive test enhancements
- `eslint.config.js` - Added Node.js environment support

### Created Files:
- `validate-test-syntax.js` - Test validation utility
- `ACCESSIBILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Detailed documentation
- `FINAL_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

The accessibility testing system is now ready for production use. The enhanced tests will run automatically via the existing GitHub Actions workflow and provide comprehensive accessibility scanning results that meet or exceed enterprise standards.

The system is configured to:
- Run automatically on PRs and weekly schedules
- Provide detailed reports for manual review
- Support multiple accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA, Section 508, etc.)
- Generate actionable feedback for developers
