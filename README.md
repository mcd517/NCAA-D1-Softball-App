# D1 College Softball Stats & Rankings

A React application powered by Vite that displays real-time NCAA Division I Softball data, including team rankings, individual statistical leaders, and tournament brackets. Data is fetched from the NCAA API through a Node.js server service.

---

## Features

- **Team Rankings**: View the latest Division I softball team rankings.
- **Statistical Leaders**: Browse top players in key hitting and pitching categories (e.g., batting average, home runs, ERA, strikeouts).
- **Tournament Bracket**: Display the current Women’s College World Series and regionals bracket.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, mobile-friendly design with loading and error states.
- **Rate-Limited API**: Server enforces rate limiting to avoid API throttling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v14+ and npm (or yarn)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mcd517/NCAA-D1-Softball-App.git
   cd NCAA-D1-Softball-App
   ```
2. Install client dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd server && npm install && cd ..
   ```

### Running in Development

1. Start the API server (default port 3001):
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
2. In a separate terminal, start the React app (default port 3000):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Building for Production

1. Build the client:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Start the server in production mode:
   ```bash
   npm start --prefix server
   ```
3. The app will serve static files from `/dist` alongside the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

The server exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/rankings` — Fetch current team rankings
- `GET /api/stats/:category` — Fetch top 50 leaders for a stat category (`batting`, `hits`, `homeRuns`, `obp`, `slg`, `era`, `strikeoutsPerSeven`, `strikeouts`)
- `GET /api/bracket` — (if implemented) Fetch tournament bracket data

## Configuration

- **Rate Limiting**: The server enforces a 1-second delay between external NCAA API calls.
- **API Base URL**: Defined in `server/services/ncaaWebScraper.js` as `https://ncaa-api.henrygd.me`.
