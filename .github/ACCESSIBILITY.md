# Web Accessibility Evaluation with AI-Powered Fixes

This repository includes automated web accessibility evaluation that runs weekly to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, with **automated GitHub Copilot integration** that creates and fixes accessibility issues automatically.

## Overview

The accessibility evaluation system consists of two integrated workflows:

1. **Comprehensive Accessibility Audit** (`comprehensive-accessibility.yml`) - Scans the application and creates GitHub issues for violations
2. **Copilot Post-Merge Analysis** (`copilot-post-merge.yml`) - Measures the effectiveness of Copilot's automated fixes

### Automated Tools Used

The system scans https://ncaa-d1-softball.netlify.app/ using multiple industry-standard tools:

- **pa11y**: Command-line accessibility testing using HTML_CodeSniffer
- **axe-core**: Accessibility testing engine by Deque Systems  
- **Lighthouse**: Google's web quality audit tool (accessibility + mobile categories)
- **Keyboard Navigation Testing**: Automated tab navigation and focus indicator verification
- **Screen Reader Simulation**: Deep analysis of heading hierarchy, landmarks, and ARIA structure

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Accessibility Fixes

### How It Works

1. **Weekly Scan**: Automated accessibility audit runs every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
2. **Issue Creation**: When violations are found, a GitHub issue is automatically created
3. **Copilot Assignment**: The issue is automatically assigned to GitHub Copilot's coding agent
4. **Automated Fixes**: Copilot analyzes the violations and creates a PR with fixes
5. **Impact Measurement**: After the PR is merged, the system re-runs scans and measures:
   - Number of issues fixed by Copilot
   - Additional issues Copilot discovered and fixed
   - Estimated time saved compared to manual fixes

### AI Fix Tracking

Each workflow run now includes a "ü§ñ Copilot Assisted Fixes" section showing:
- **Fixes applied by Copilot**: Number of violations automatically resolved
- **Additional issues found**: New accessibility improvements Copilot discovered
- **Time saved**: Estimated hours saved vs. manual accessibility remediation

## Multi-Tool Approach Benefits

Each tool provides different perspectives on accessibility compliance:

- **axe-core**: Excellent for structural/semantic WCAG violations (landmarks, headings, ARIA)
- **pa11y**: HTML_CodeSniffer-based testing with different rule interpretations  
- **Lighthouse Mobile**: Mobile-specific accessibility testing with Google's scoring
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Automated simulation of tab navigation patterns
- **Screen Reader Analysis**: ARIA structure and landmark validation

**Important Note**: Lighthouse uses a weighted scoring system where some critical accessibility audits (like `landmark-one-main`) are hidden from the final score. Our workflow extracts and reports these hidden audit results to provide complete coverage.

## Schedule & Triggers

The accessibility scan runs automatically:
- **Weekly**: Every Monday at 9:00 AM UTC
- **On-demand**: Can be triggered manually via GitHub Actions
- **Post-merge**: Automatically runs after Copilot merges accessibility fixes

## Reports Generated

After each scan, detailed reports are generated and stored as workflow artifacts:

### Accessibility Audit Reports
- `pa11y-report.html` - Visual report with highlighted issues and recommendations
- `pa11y-report.json` - Machine-readable JSON data for integration
- `pa11y-report.csv` - Spreadsheet-compatible format for analysis
- `axe-report.json` - Detailed violation analysis with WCAG references
- `lighthouse-accessibility.report.html` - Interactive accessibility audit
- `lighthouse-accessibility-mobile.report.json` - Mobile accessibility data
- `keyboard-nav.json` - Keyboard navigation test results
- `screenreader-simulation.json` - Screen reader compatibility analysis

### AI Analysis Reports
- `README.md` - Comprehensive executive summary with actionable fix guidance
- `copilot-summary.json` - Copilot effectiveness metrics and time savings

- **Content Issues**: Alt text, labels, contrast violations
- **Copilot Impact**: Fixes applied and time saved
- **Action Plan**: Prioritized next steps with time estimates

## Understanding Results

### Issue Prioritization

The system automatically prioritizes issues in this order:

1. **üö® Critical Issues (Fix First)** - WCAG violations that significantly impact users
2. **üèóÔ∏è Structural Issues (High Priority)** - Foundation problems affecting screen readers
3. **üìù Content Quality Issues (Medium Priority)** - Markup and content accessibility
4. **ü§ñ AI-Assisted Fixes** - Issues Copilot can automatically resolve

### Multi-Layer Analysis

The solution provides four complementary perspectives:

1. **axe-core**: Precise WCAG violation detection
2. **pa11y**: HTML_CodeSniffer rule validation
3. **Lighthouse**: User experience impact scoring (desktop + mobile)
4. **AI Analysis**: Pattern recognition and automated fix suggestions

## Standards Compliance

The scans test for compliance with:
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards
- **Mobile Accessibility** requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation** support
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**
- **ARIA Best Practices**
- **Semantic HTML Structure** requirements

## üîß Quick Component Fixes
