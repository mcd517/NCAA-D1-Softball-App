Focus Area: Enterprise Accessibility Scanning Tool Only

Purpose

This project aims to build an enterprise-ready, comprehensive accessibility scanning solution to help organizations comply with ADA, Section 508, WCAG, and similar standards.

The immediate goal is to perfect the accessibility scan itselfâ€”not to remediate or fix accessibility issues at this time.

Focus your efforts on refining, extending, and optimizing the Unified Accessibility Scanner, ensuring we don't create duplicative functionalities, and aligning with the goal of making it a robust, enterprise-ready tool.

Scope:

Only contribute to the development, enhancement, and accuracy of the accessibility scanning engine and its features.
Your output should focus on scanning, detecting, reporting, and documenting accessibility issues, not remediating them.

Do NOT:

Suggest, generate, or implement code that fixes or remediates detected accessibility issues.
Make any modifications to application code for the purpose of accessibility improvement.
Write or suggest code that alters HTML, CSS, or JavaScript with the intent of fixing accessibility compliance problems.

DO:

Improve the detection algorithms for accessibility violations.
Enhance reporting, logging, and export features for scan results.
Support multiple standards (ADA, 508, WCAG, etc.) in the scanning logic.
Write tests and documentation focused on scan accuracy and coverage.
Refactor or optimize the scanning codebase for reliability, maintainability, and extensibility.
Ensure documentation (.MD) files are updated for accuracy with each change/commit.
Ensure that we are not creating duplicative/excees code and files. Default to small and modular.
Fully explain any changes, suggestions, etc.

Clarifications:

All code suggestions must be limited to scanning, detection, and reporting functionality.
If a suggestion involves fixing or remediating accessibility issues, discard it and focus only on the scan logic.
Summary
DO: Perfect the accessibility scan engine and reporting.
DO NOT: Fix or suggest fixes for accessibility issues themselves.

Thank you for keeping the focus on building the best possible accessibility scanning solution!
